\section{Second Generation Sequencing}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Cheaper and high-throughput
\item Shorter reads
\item More errors (?)
\end{enumerate}

\section{\dBG based assembly}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Becomes relevant when EULER paper shows that eulerian path can be used, rather than hamiltonian path.
\item Graph representation is biggest bottleneck due to high use of memory
\end{enumerate}
